First, download the data to your PC.
Go to https://gdc.cancer.gov/ to download the TCGA-Invasive Breast Carcinoma PanCancer Atlas.
Files should be extracted into directories.
Navigate to the extracted folders in the directory.
Step 2: Examine Information
Open data_clinical_patient.txt and read the clinical data.
Open data_mrna_seq_v2_rsem.txt and read the RNA-seq data.
From data_cna.txt, read the CNA data.
Look up the ERBB2 gene in the CNA data.
Divide the patients into those who have increased ERBB2 and those who don't.
Add metadata with the ERBB2 status.
Step 3: Analysis of Differential Expression
Install and open the package DESeq2.
RNA-seq data and ERBB2 status are used to create a DESeqDataSet object.
Carry out the normalization.
Do an analysis of differential expression.
List the top genes with differential expression.
Analyze pathways more thoroughly with clusterProfiler.Obtain transformed expression values stabilized by variance.
Run a PCA.
Phase Four: Gene Expression Cluster
Install the Biobase package and load it.
From the DESeqDataSet, extract the assay matrix.
Run a PCA.
After matrix transposition, carry out hierarchical clustering.
To create clusters, chop the tree.
Create a factor out of cut_tree_result.
Use color clustering to visualize PCA.
